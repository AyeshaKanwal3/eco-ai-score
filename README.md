AI EcoRank Studio: When the Web Seeks to Breathe
AI EcoRank Studio is a revolutionary platform that assesses websites not only for their performance and discoverability but also for their environmental impact and AI friendliness. Our mission is to promote a digital ecosystem where sustainability and intelligent accessibility go hand in hand.

Overview
In an era where billions of websites compete for attention, the digital footprint of each page matters. Every visit consumes energy, produces carbon emissions, and adds to digital waste. Simultaneously, AI systems rely on well-structured, accessible data to serve meaningful content.

AI EcoRank Studio evaluates websites based on:

Eco-friendliness: How optimized and lightweight is the website?
AI Discoverability: How easily can AI systems read and interpret the site?
Compatibility: How well does the site work across browsers and devices?
User Experience: How accessible and engaging is the site for humans?

By highlighting strengths and areas for improvement, our platform helps creators build websites that are sustainable, AI-ready, and user-friendly.
